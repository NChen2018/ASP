The program should be executed in the way such as:

./combiner 10 5 inputFile

The folder contains two input files, input1.txt and input2.txt. For input1.txt, the user ID is sorted so the output is also sorted by user ID which you can see in output1.txt. For input2.txt, the user ID is not sorted so the output is not sorted by user ID which you can see in output2.txt.

input1.txt and input2.txt are executed with the parameter 10 and 5.
